                Dorothy Noles, lovingly known as Dot, was born in Louisville, Kentucky.
                She was raised primarily in Opelika, Alabama. She was college educated
                but enjoyed motherhood over all else. Dot birthed eight kids but was mother
                too ohh so many more and out of necessity became a great cook. She
                enjoyed nothing more than to see the look of satisfaction on the lips of all
                who enjoyed her tasty creations. The family migrated to Detroit, Michigan.
                Dots kids grew and left the nest. This is when Dot took her passion to the
                professional level. In the beginning she catered from home. She soon
                became the talk of the town by all of her church members and family friends.
                After opening the family restaurant THE PIZZA PUB AND SOUL-FOOD
                RESTURANT, her client list grew to include the Board of Education, The
                Mayor’s office, the city of Southfield, Aretha Franklin, and many of the who’s
                who in Michigan. She created quite a name at Hart Plaza, where she gained
                the name “THE FISH LADY”. During the summer festivals her fish meals
                became a must have for all the locals and visitors’ alike. Dot excelled in the
                culinary field but had such passion for baking, this was her relaxing time. We
                invite you to come on down and try out the menu Taste the LOVE. Momma
                would never let anyone leave hungry.
